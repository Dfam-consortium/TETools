# Dfam TE Tools Container
> Note that as of version 1.88 TETools contains RepeatMasker 4.1.6. This version of RepeatMasker uses a new version of [FamDB](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/FamDB) with a new format. This README contains instructions for modifying the files available to the TETools container, but the README file in the FamDB repository contains more information on the format itself.

Dfam TE Tools includes RepeatMasker, RepeatModeler, and coseg. This container is
an easy way to get a minimal yet fully functional installation of RepeatMasker
and RepeatModeler and is additionally useful for testing or reproducibility
purposes.

You should consider using the Dfam TE Tools container if:

* You or your computing environment already use docker or singularity
* You are uncomfortable compiling dependencies by hand or have had problems
  doing so
* You do not need to use any of the other tools (e.g. RMBlast, HMMER) for
  anything besides RepeatMasker and RepeatModeler

You should install RepeatMasker and/or RepeatModeler manually if:

* You do not have the necessary system permissions to install and/or run docker
  or singularity
* You need to install a different version of a dependency
* You need to compile a dependency in a specific way
* You need to use RepeatMasker as part of another pipeline
* You need to use AB-BLAST or Cross-Match. Either AB-BLAST or Cross-Match can
  probably be used with this container, but it is inconvenient and not tested.

## Using the Container

### Requirements

* A 64-bit Linux operating system, or appropriate virtualization software.
  Docker for Mac is known to work, including the wrapper script, but we do not
  regularly test this platform ourselves.
* `singularity` or `docker` installed with permissions to run containers. For
  `docker`, this usually means being in the `docker` group or running the
  container as the `root` user.

### Using the Wrapper Script

We provide a wrapper script, `dfam-tetools.sh`, which does most of the work automatically.

The wrapper script does the following:
* Runs the container from Docker Hub. You can also use the `--container` option to
  specify a different version of the container or an `.sif` file for singularity.
* Uses `singularity` if it is available, or `docker`. You can choose between them
  with the `--docker` or `--singularity` options.
* Runs the container as the current user, with the current working directory accessible
  from within the container. Depending on the environment and the software used, this
  directory appears inside the container at its original location and/or at the path `/work`.
* Binds a directory, ideally named `Libraries`, into the container over 
  `/opt/RepeatMasker/Libraries` with the `--library` option. This is intended to enable the 
  modification of local FamDB files, as the container is packaged with a minimal FamDB file. 
  Note that this will overwrite the library files within the container. To avoid this, copy 
  those files to the host system using the steps below under 
  **Customizing the RepeatMasker libraries**.

```
curl -sSLO https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/TETools/raw/master/dfam-tetools.sh
chmod +x dfam-tetools.sh
./dfam-tetools.sh
```

Inside the container, the included tools are now available:

```
BuildDatabase -name genome1 genome1.fa
RepeatModeler -database genome1 [-LTRStruct] [-threads 16]

RepeatMasker genome1.fa [-lib library.fa] [-pa 8]

runcoseg.pl -d -m 50 -c ALU.cons -s ALU.seqs -i ALU.ins
```

### Running the Container Manually

The container can also be run manually, bypassing the wrapper script:

* `docker run -it --rm dfam/tetools:latest`
* `singularity run docker://dfam/tetools:latest`

When running the container manually, you will also need to set the UID/GID,
directories to mount, and so on according to your needs. By default singularity
mounts the current directory and your `HOME` directory; docker does neither.

You can also use `singularity pull` to download the container to a file:

```
singularity pull dfam-tetools-latest.sif docker://dfam/tetools:latest
singularity run dfam-tetools-latest.sif
```

### Customizing the RepeatMasker libraries
<!-- previous header name / link: --><a id="using-repbase-repeatmasker-edition"></a>

Currently, RepeatMasker is installed without a TE library, however it will support 
annotation with custom libraries (using the -lib mylib.fa command line option).  

Additional setup is necesary to use TE libraries such as Dfam or RepBase for use
with the container. Modifying the container can become a quite complex task, depending on
which software and versions are being used and how the system is configured. Instead
these instructions will create a modifiable local `Libraries` folder that can be 
mounted back into the container.

The first step is to copy the RepeatMasker Libraries out of the container to the host filesystem:
```sh
# Enter the container tagged with <tag>. This command will also mount your current directory to 
# /work inside the container
docker run -it --rm --workdir /work -v $(pwd):/work dfam/tetools:<tag>

# confirm visibility to your working directory
ls

# Make a copy of the original RepeatMasker Libraries/ directory on your host filesystem
cp -r /opt/RepeatMasker/Libraries/ ./

# exit the container
exit

# Make sure you own the Libraries folder
chown -R $USER ./Libraries/

# Remove the minimal famdb files
rm ./Libraries/famdb/*
```

To include Dfam you will need to download one or more famdb partitions from 
the Dfam site. The top level partition ( partition 0 ) will be necessary, however
additional partitions are optional.  The contents of the partitions for the current
release can be found here [FamDB README](https://www.dfam.org/releases/current/families/FamDB/README.txt).
The partitions may be downloaded from here [Dfam.org](https://www.dfam.org/releases/current/families/FamDB/).

To include the Dfam FamDB files, download, unzip, and include them in `Libraries/famdb`.
They will be detected and included in queries automatically. 

Whenever you modify the FamDB files, the RepeatMasker libraries must be regenerated.
```sh
# run the container binding your host Libraries directory over the RepeatMasker directory
docker run -it --rm -v <host path>/Libraries:/opt/RepeatMasker/Libraries dfam/tetools:<tag>

# navigate to the RepeatMasker folder
cd /opt/RepeatMasker

# unlock libaries for reconfiguring 
rm ./Libraries/famdb/rmlib.config

# run the reconfigure script
./tetoolsDfamUpdate.pl
```

To include RepBase data, download and unzip `RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-#######.tar.gz` into `Libraries` and run the updater script.
```sh
# Unpack the RepBase data
tar -xvzf /work/path/to/Libaries/RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-#######.tar.gz

# run the container. You can also use the first command above again
./dfam-tetools.sh --docker

# navigate to the RepeatMasker folder
cd /opt/RepeatMasker

# unlock libaries for reconfiguring 
rm ./Libraries/famdb/rmlib.config

# rerun the reconfigure script
./tetoolsDfamUpdate.pl
```

When using the image with the new `Libraries` folder, mount it to the container using the `-v` argument.
All paths must be absolute. `./dfam-tetools.sh` does this automatically.
```
-v <host filesystem path to Libraries>/Libraries:/opt/RepeatMasker/Libraries
```
Note that the process for modifying the files in a Singularity container is identical, but the arguments vary slightly. For example, instead of `-v` Singularity uses `-B`. `dfam-tetools.sh` also does not currently automatically mount host library directories for Singularity. 


<br>
You can now specify this `Libraries/` directory by setting the `LIBDIR`
environment variable, for example with the `export LIBDIR=` command or `-e
LIBDIR=` depending on you are running the container. 

When you use a new version of the TETools container (particularly a new RepeatMasker), 
you should re-create the `Libraries` directory for the new version.

```sh
# Set the LIBDIR environment variable before running RepeatMasker
export LIBDIR=/path/to/Libraries
RepeatMasker genome.fa
```

## Building the Container

You will need:

* `curl`
* `docker`, with permissions to build containers
* `singularity` (optional) - if building a singularity container

```sh
# Download dependencies
./getsrc.sh

# Build a docker container
docker build -t org/name:tag .

# or 
docker build --network host -t org/name:tag .

# (optional) build a singularity container
singularity build dfam-tetools.sif dfam-tetools.def
```
